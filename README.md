## Overview
It is a social distance detector based on OPENCV  used to find track persons who are following social distance and who are not following.  

## Motivation
Limiting face-to-face contact with others is the best way to reduce the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Social distancing, also called ‚Äúphysical distancing,‚Äù means keeping space between yourself and other people outside of your home.

This Project/Idea is very much helpful for government and police to track people in public places through the help of artificial intelligence.

## Technical Aspect

Here in this project I used MobilenetSSD and YOLOV3 to detect the persons in the video and used a basic algorithm created by me to detect whether the distance between any 2 persons is greater than 1.5 feet is marked as safe and other are marked as unsafe. Persons who are unsafe are marked with red border and people who are safe are marked as green border .  

## Installation
1. If you like my project do üåüüåü my repository.

2. Clone my repository by using following command in terminal/Command Prompt.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ksdkamesh99/Social-Distance-Detector.git
```

3. Now we need to install required libraries like opencv,spacy etc.  

4. You need to download YOLOV3 weights for 608x608 dimensions from darknet. [Check Here](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights)

5. Based on the input type commands are here:
    1. If your input type is a image and want to detect then type your relative image path as argument in terminal..
    ```sh
    python app_image.py "test_image.jpg"
    ```
    2. If your input type is a video and want to detect using mobilenet_ssd then type your relative video path as argument in terminal.
    ```sh
    python app_video.py "test_video."
    ```
    3. If your input type is a image and want to detect usiing YOLOV3 608x608 then type your relative video path as argument in terminal..
    ```sh
    python app_yolo.py "test_video."
    ```    
## To Do in future:-

1. Need to ad bird view to the project

2. Improve accuracy
